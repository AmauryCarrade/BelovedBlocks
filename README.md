## Features

The 1.8 version of minecraft has removed the items that corresponds to some unobtainables blocks in survival. Although their corresponding items doesn't exist anymore, the blocks still exist. You can place them by doing a  `/setblock` command with some metadata arguments.

This plugin instances new items that transforms themselves into the desired special block when placed by a player.
